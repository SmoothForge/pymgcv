    """Duchon spline basis - a generalization of thin plate splines.

    These smoothers allow the use of lower orders of derivative in the penalty than
    conventional thin plate splines, while still yielding continuous functions.

    The description, adapted from mgcv is as follows: Duchonâ€™s (1977) construction
    generalizes the usual thin plate spline penalty as follows. The usual thin plate
    spline penalty is given by the integral of the squared Euclidian norm of a vector of
    mixed partial $m$-th order derivatives of the function w.r.t. its arguments. Duchon
    re-expresses this penalty in the Fourier domain, and then weights the squared norm
    in the integral by the Euclidean norm of the fourier frequencies, raised to the
    power $2s$, where $s$ is a user selected constant.

    If $d$ is the number of arguments of the smooth:

    - It is required that $-d/2 < s < d/2$.
    - If $s=0$ then the usual thin plate spline is recovered.
    - To obtain continuous functions we further require that $m + s > d/2$.

    For example, ``DuchonSpline(m=1, s=d/2)`` can be used in order to use first
    derivative penalization for any $d$, and still yield continuous functions.
