# pymgcv

### Installation

Currently in development. As this is a multilanguage project (R and Python), we use 
[pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/), a package management tool which supports this.

``pymgcv`` can be installed by installing [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/), and running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielward27/pymgcv.git
cd pymgcv
pixi shell
```
For development, install using
```bash
pixi shell --environment=dev
```
